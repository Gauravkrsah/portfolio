# Security Check for Public Repository

This file confirms that all sensitive information is properly secured before making the repository public.

## Secured Information

All sensitive information has been moved to GitHub repository secrets and will not be exposed when the repository is made public:

- ✅ CPANEL_FTP_SERVER
- ✅ CPANEL_FTP_USERNAME
- ✅ CPANEL_FTP_PASSWORD
- ✅ GEMINI_API_KEY
- ✅ GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- ✅ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- ✅ RESEND_API_KEY
- ✅ SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- ✅ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- ✅ SUPABASE_URL

## Safety Checklist

- ✅ All `.env` files are properly gitignored
- ✅ No hardcoded API keys or passwords in the codebase
- ✅ Deployment scripts only reference secrets through GitHub environment variables
- ✅ No private keys committed to the repository
- ✅ No personal information exposed

## GitHub Workflow Security

The GitHub workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) properly accesses secrets using:
```yaml
${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
```

## Making Repository Public

When changing repository visibility to public:
1. GitHub will warn you about any potential security risks
2. The secrets will remain secure and not be exposed
3. Automated deployments will continue to work correctly

## Additional Notes

If you ever need to add new secrets:
1. Add them to the GitHub repository secrets
2. Reference them in the workflow file using `${{ secrets.NEW_SECRET_NAME }}`
3. Update this file to document the new secret
